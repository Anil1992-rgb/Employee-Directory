## User Directory

Directory app built with React.

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user will be able to:

  * Sort the table by Name

  * Filter the users by searching through first name

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
